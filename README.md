# Climate Data Project

## Project Introduction 
I am impressed with the climate of the Madison, Wisconsin area: bitterly cold winters and hot, humid summers, very different from the inland cities at the same latitude as my hometown. To quantify this difference, this project collected and analysed monthly average temperature (TAVG) and monthly total precipitation (PRCP) data from four weather stations over the period 2014-2024, and used an additive time-series decomposition method (Seasonal Decompose) to extract the trend, seasonality, and residual components, which ultimately confirms that Madison has a hot-summer Humid continental climate (KÃ¶ppen Dfa)
